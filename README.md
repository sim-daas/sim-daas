# Helll everyone, I'm Ishaan! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a 1st-year B.Tech student with a strong interest in computer vision, machine learning, and robotics. My GitHub repositories showcase a variety of projects that reflect my skills and passion for these fields. Here is an overview of what I have been working on:

## Projects and Skills

### [Driver Drowsiness Detection](https://github.com/sim-daas/driver-drowsiness-detector)
- **Skills:** YOLOv11, OpenCV, PyTorch, Python
- **Description:** A system to detect driver drowsiness using machine learning techniques to enhance road safety. The system employs a camera to monitor the driver's facial features and triggers an alert if drowsiness is detected.

### [AI Sentry Gun](https://github.com/sim-daas/sentry-turret)
- **Skills:** YOLOv11, Arduino, Computer Vision, Python, C++
- **Description:** An autonomous sentry gun system that uses computer vision and machine learning to detect, track, and aim at faces or objects in real-time. The system calculates the position of the target and controls servo motors for precise aiming.

### [MultiModal RAG Chatbot](https://github.com/sim-daas/multimodal-rag)
- **Skills:** FastAPI, Ollama, RAG, Multimodal Processing, Python
- **Description:** A powerful, extensible chatbot with multimodal capabilities, built with FastAPI and Ollama. It supports text, image, and audio processing, enhancing responses with relevant context from a document knowledge base or web search.

### [ROS2 and NVIDIA DeepStream Integration](https://github.com/sim-daas/roswithai)
- **Skills:** ROS2, Gazebo, NVIDIA DeepStream, YOLOv8, Docker, Python
- **Description:** Integrates ROS2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA DeepStream for advanced tracking and computer vision tasks. The setup supports real-time video analytics with YOLOv8-based inference within a ROS2 control framework.

### [System Setup for Robotics](https://github.com/sim-daas/systemsetup)
- **Skills:** Linux System Configuration, Neovim, Alacritty, Zsh, Python Libraries
